# Documentation for the Project

This documentation provides an overview of the project structure, classes, and configurations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several packages, each serving a specific purpose:

- `homework.config`: Contains the configuration classes for the application.
- `homework.dao`: Provides data access objects for interacting with the database.
- `homework.dao.impl`: Implements the data access objects using JPA and EntityManager.
- `homework.domain`: Defines the domain models or entities for the application.
- `homework.service`: Defines the service interfaces for performing CRUD operations.
- `homework.service.impl`: Implements the service interfaces using the corresponding DAOs.

## Configuration

The main configuration class for the application is `ConfigApp` located in the `homework.config` package. It is annotated with `@Configuration` to indicate that it provides bean definitions for the application context.

### ConfigApp

- `@ComponentScan`: Specifies the base packages to scan for components such as DAOs and services.
- `@EnableTransactionManagement`: Enables Spring's transaction management capabilities.
- `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass = true)`: Enables support for AspectJ annotations for AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).

## Bean Definitions

- `transactionManager`: Defines the transaction manager bean for managing transactions in the application.
- `dataSource`: Creates a `DriverManagerDataSource` bean for configuring the database connection.
- `jpaVendorAdapter`: Creates a `HibernateJpaVendorAdapter` bean for configuring JPA vendor-specific properties.
- `entityManagerFactory`: Creates a `LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` bean for configuring the JPA entity manager factory.

## DAO (Data Access Object)

The DAO package contains interfaces and their implementations for data access operations.

### CrudDao

- `CrudDao<T>`: An interface defining CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities of type `T`.
    - `add`: Adds a new entity to the database.
    - `findById`: Retrieves an entity by its ID from the database.
    - `findAll`: Retrieves all entities of type `T` from the database.
    - `update`: Updates an existing entity in the database.
    - `delete`: Deletes an entity by its ID from the database.

### PhoneDaoImpl

- `PhoneDaoImpl`: An implementation of the `CrudDao` interface for the `Phone` entity.
    - Implements the CRUD operations using JPA's `EntityManager` for interacting with the database.

### StudentDaoImpl

- `StudentDaoImpl`: An implementation of the `CrudDao` interface for the `Student` entity.
    - Implements the CRUD operations using JPA's `EntityManager` for interacting with the database.

## Domain

The domain package contains the entity classes representing the domain model of the application.

### Phone

- `Phone`: Represents a phone entity with attributes such as `id`, `number`, and a many-to-one relationship with the `Student` entity.

### Student

- `Student`: Represents a student entity with attributes such as `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and a one-to-many relationship with the `Phone` entity.

## Service

The service package contains interfaces and their implementations for providing business logic.

### CrudService

- `CrudService<T>`: An interface defining CRUD operations on entities of type `T`.
    - `add`: Adds a new entity.
    - `findById`: Retrieves an entity by its ID.
    - `findAll`: Retrieves all entities of type `T`.
    - `update`: Updates an existing entity.
    - `delete`: Deletes an entity by its ID.

### PhoneServiceImpl

- `PhoneServiceImpl`: An implementation of the `CrudService` interface for the `Phone` entity.
    - Uses the corresponding `PhoneDao` implementation for performing CRUD operations.

### StudentServiceImpl

- `StudentServiceImpl`: An implementation of the `CrudService` interface for the `Student` entity.
    - Uses the corresponding `StudentDao` implementation for performing CRUD operations.

## Main Class

The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the application.

- It creates an instance of `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` and initializes the Spring application context with the `ConfigApp` configuration class.
- It retrieves instances of the `StudentService` and `PhoneService` beans from the application context.
- Various operations such as adding, updating, and retrieving entities are performed using the service beans.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the project structure, classes, and configurations. It helps in understanding the organization of the code and the functionality provided by each component.
